    You may be at risk for (in other words, more likely to get) high blood sugar
    and type 2 diabetes based on risk factors you may have. High blood sugar and
    diabetes can lead to heart disease and stroke.


    Many factors increase a person’s risk for high blood sugar including: being
    45 years or older; being overweight; having a parent, brother or sister with
    diabetes; or if you are a woman with a history of  diabetes while pregnant
    (gestational diabetes) or polycystic ovarian syndrome (a condition where the
    ovaries produce higher-than-normal amounts of certain hormones). If you are
    African-American, Hispanic, Alaskan Native, American Indian, Asian American,
    or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander you may also be more likely to have high
    blood sugar.
  Recommendation: >-
    Experts (i.e., [The U.S. Preventive Services Task
    Force](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/about-the-uspstf))
    recommend blood tests to measure blood sugar levels if you are at increased
    risk. If the tests show you have high blood sugar, there are steps you can
    take to help lower your blood sugar and prevent diabetes.


    Contact your doctor to schedule an appointment and ask about being tested
    for high blood sugar and diabetes.
